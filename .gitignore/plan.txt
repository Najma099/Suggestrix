A scalable, real-time auto-suggestion and auto-correction system that:

Fetches words from Wikipedia API dynamically
Stores words in MySQL along with their frequency
Uses Tries for fast lookups & MySQL for ranking
Updates frequency dynamically each time a user selects a word
Ensures high availability with multiple data copies (fail-safe mechanism)
Deploys with a simple, clean website interface



Since we have plan of inserting 2-4M of data we thought of creating 26 Tries with a Zookeeper
